Lab-exercise-13/3/18-iOS

a)	Create a new swift project and create the following class:
Name of the class is Employee, having the following stored properties - employee id, employee name, gross sales (amount in dollars) and commission rate.
Define the following initializers:
One designated initializer which initializes all the properties with values.
One designated initializer which initializes all the properties with default values.
One convenience initializer which initializes only employee id and employee name.
Add the validations so that there won't be negative values for gross sales and commission rate.
Add a method in the class - calculateSalary()-> Double which calculates and returns  the earnings of an employee ( formula: gross sales * commission rate/100) 
Also add a method which returns the sting representation of all the property values.
In the main.swift file,  create at least two objects of the employee class and test it.
